# Layer8Culture Content Engine

An automated social media pipeline: **Copilot CLI** (brain) → **OpenAI** (visuals) → **PR approval** (you) → **Postiz** (posting) → **daily report** (back to you).

## How it works

```
transcripts/ + calendar/topics.md + brand/ + live AI-news research
        │
        ▼  (nightly GitHub Action)
  Copilot CLI researches the day's AI news + generates posts + visual prompts
        │
        ▼
  OpenAI generates fresh visuals per post (image / carousel slides) at 2K,
  Sora-2 (Azure) renders Reels from the stills — ffmpeg is the fallback
        │
        ▼
  Pull Request opened (with a visual preview)  ──►  YOU review/edit/merge (GitHub mobile)
        │
        ▼  (merge to main)
  Posts + media pushed to Postiz → scheduled (feed / carousel / Reel / story)
        │
        ▼  (every morning)
  Daily report + Instagram Insights feedback loop steers the next day
```

> **Two channels.** The engine runs **two separate pipelines**:
> - **layer8culture — viral video + Instagram** (nightly) — the core output is **4-5
>   viral short-form videos/day**: 8-12s Sora cinematics with **huge burned-in overlay text**
>   on a 3-beat arc (pattern interrupt → transformation → punchline/CTA), across 5 viral
>   pillars, with hooks scored by the **STEPPS** framework (see `brand/viral-formats.md`).
>   Each master posts to **TikTok**; the top 1-2 also cross-post to **Instagram Reels** and
>   **YouTube Shorts** (one render, reused). Instagram additionally gets **carousels** (saves)
>   and a **story** (engagement). A nightly
>   **analytics** job pulls Instagram Insights into `analytics/insights-digest.md`,
>   which feeds back into generation to grow toward 4k+ followers. Steer it via
>   `scripts/generation-prompt.md`, `brand/viral-formats.md`, and `calendar/topics.md`.
> - **Layer8Culture Radio (lofi) Instagram + YouTube** (daily) — calm, premium
>   focus-music content for the 24/7 livestream funnel: live-stream promos,
>   quote cards, loop-preview Reels, playlist/community posts, and behind-the-scenes
>   posts. It also cross-posts its loop-reel to the lofi YouTube channel as a Short. Its own
>   prompt (`scripts/generation-prompt-lofi.md`), queue files (`queue/lofi-*.json`),
>   workflow (`generate-lofi.yml`), and approval PR. Steer it via
>   `calendar/topics-lofi.md`. (X remains paused for both brands; lofi TikTok is paused.)
> - **The Real Estate Deal Lab (client brand) Instagram** (daily) — fully isolated
>   client lane for premium real estate deal education. It uses client files under
>   `clients/therealestatedeallab/`, writes `queue/deallab-*.json`, and opens a
>   separate approval PR from `generate-deallab.yml`. It does not read Layer8Culture
>   or Layer8Culture Radio brand docs.

## Setup (one-time)

1. **Create a private GitHub repo** and push this folder to it.
2. **Deploy Postiz** (already provisioned on Azure for this project):
   - Runs via `docker compose` on an Ubuntu VM (`rg-postiz` / `postiz-vm`),
     fronted by Caddy for automatic HTTPS at a `sslip.io` domain tied to the
     VM's static IP (swap in a custom domain like `post.layer8culture.io` later
     by pointing an A record at the IP and editing `/opt/postiz/Caddyfile`).
   - **Register** the first account in the Postiz UI (it becomes admin), then
     **create an API key** under Settings → API.
   - **Instagram requires a Meta app** (Instagram Graph API): put its
     `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` / `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` (and/or `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` /
     `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`) in `/opt/postiz/social.env` on the VM, then
     `sudo docker compose up -d`. Connection details are kept out of git in the
     session's `files/postiz-deployment.md`.
3. **Add GitHub repo secrets** (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
   | Secret | What it is |
   |---|---|
   | `COPILOT_CLI_TOKEN` | A token the Copilot CLI accepts for authentication. A **fine-grained** PAT with the **Copilot Requests** permission works only if your account/enterprise policy allows PAT-based Copilot access. If that's blocked, use the OAuth token the CLI stores after you run `copilot` → `/login` with your Copilot-seat account (a `gho_` token; classic `ghp_` PATs are NOT supported). |
   | `ENGINE_PR_TOKEN` | A user PAT with `repo` scope, used **only** to open the nightly approval PR. Required because the org disables "Allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests", so the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` can't create it — a PR authored by a real user can. |
   | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | From platform.openai.com (image generation). Used as the **fallback** image backend when the Azure secrets below are not set. |
   | `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | **Optional (preferred image backend).** Your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint, e.g. `https://my-resource.openai.azure.com`. When this plus `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_IMAGE_DEPLOYMENT` are all set, `openai_gen.py` uses Azure OpenAI for images instead of `OPENAI_API_KEY`. |
   | `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | **Optional.** Key for the Azure OpenAI resource above. |
   | `AZURE_OPENAI_IMAGE_DEPLOYMENT` | **Optional.** The **deployment name** of your gpt-image model on Azure (this is passed as the model id — not `gpt-image-2`). |
   | `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` | **Optional** repo **variable** (Settings → Variables → Actions), not a secret. The Azure API version that supports gpt-image generation/edits. Defaults to `2025-04-01-preview` when unset. |
   | `AZURE_OPENAI_VIDEO_DEPLOYMENT` | **Optional** repo **variable** (not a secret). The **deployment name** of your Sora-2 video model on Azure (e.g. `sora-2`). When set (with the `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`/`AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` above), `reel_gen.py` renders Reels with Sora-2; otherwise it falls back to ffmpeg "motion". |
   | `AZURE_OPENAI_VIDEO_API_VERSION` | **Optional** repo **variable** (not a secret). The Azure API version for Sora video. Defaults to `preview` when unset. |
   | `AZURE_OPENAI_VIDEO_SIZE` | **Optional** repo **variable** (not a secret). Explicit Sora canvas size, e.g. `1024x1792`. The base `sora-2` model supports only `720x1280` / `1280x720` (the default); the 2K tier (`1024x1792` / `1792x1024`) needs a **`sora-2-pro`** deployment — point `AZURE_OPENAI_VIDEO_DEPLOYMENT` at it and set this to `1024x1792`. |
   | `OPENAI_IMAGE_QUALITY` | **Optional** repo **variable** (not a secret). Image quality tier — `low` / `medium` / `high`. Defaults to **`high`** when empty/unset. A post can still override per item via `visual.quality`. |
   | `OPENAI_IMAGE_2K` | **Optional** repo **variable** (not a secret). Whether to upscale each still to a **2K master** (long edge `OPENAI_IMAGE_LONG_EDGE`) before compositing brand type. **On** by default; set `0` to disable. |
   | `OPENAI_IMAGE_LONG_EDGE` | **Optional** repo **variable** (not a secret). Target long-edge in px for the 2K master. Defaults to `2048` when empty/unset. |
   | `POSTIZ_URL` | e.g. `https://post.layer8culture.io` |
   | `POSTIZ_API_KEY` | From your Postiz instance |
   | `LOFI_IG_CHANNEL_ID` | **Optional override.** The Layer8Culture Radio Instagram channel is already wired in `post_to_postiz.py`; set this only to point lofi posts at a different Postiz integration ID (e.g. after re-connecting the channel). |
   | `TIKTOK_CHANNEL_ID` | **Required to publish TikTok.** The Postiz integration ID for the layer8culture TikTok channel. Until it's set, `INTEGRATIONS[("layer8culture","tiktok")]` stays `REPLACE_ME` and TikTok posts are **skipped, not errored** — so the engine can ship TikTok content the moment you connect TikTok in Postiz and add this secret. |
   | `YOUTUBE_LAYER8_CHANNEL_ID` | **Required to publish layer8culture YouTube Shorts.** The Postiz integration ID for the layer8culture YouTube channel. Unset -> those Shorts are **skipped, not errored**. (Distinct from `YT_CHANNEL_ID`, the RSS channel id used by `fetch_youtube.py`.) |
   | `YOUTUBE_LOFI_CHANNEL_ID` | **Required to publish lofi YouTube Shorts.** The Postiz integration ID for the Layer8Culture Radio YouTube channel. Unset -> those Shorts are skipped, not errored. |
   | `DEALLAB_IG_CHANNEL_ID` | **Required to publish The Real Estate Deal Lab Instagram posts.** Unset -> client posts are skipped, not errored. |
   | `IG_USER_ID` | Instagram **Business** account user id (for the insights loop) |
   | `IG_GRAPH_TOKEN` | Long-lived Instagram Graph API token with `instagram_basic`, `instagram_manage_insights`, `pages_read_engagement` (reuses your Meta app) |
   | `REPORT_WEBHOOK` | Discord/Slack webhook for the daily report (optional) |
4. **Map your Instagram channel** — in Postiz, connect the Layer8Culture
   Instagram account (an IG **Business/Creator** account linked to a Facebook
   Page), then open **Settings → API** to copy that channel's **integration ID**.
   Paste it into `scripts/post_to_postiz.py` → `INTEGRATIONS[("layer8culture",
   "instagram")]`, replacing `REPLACE_ME`. The **Layer8Culture Radio (lofi)**
   account is already wired in `INTEGRATIONS[("lofi", "instagram")]`; set the
   `LOFI_IG_CHANNEL_ID` secret only if you re-connect it and need to override the ID.
   To publish **TikTok**, connect the layer8culture TikTok account in Postiz, copy its
   integration ID, and add it as the `TIKTOK_CHANNEL_ID` secret — TikTok posts are
   skipped (not errored) until it's set. Full walkthrough:
   [`docs/postiz-tiktok-setup.md`](docs/postiz-tiktok-setup.md). The remaining
   `REPLACE_ME` entries (X for both brands, lofi TikTok) stay paused — unmapped posts
   are skipped, not errored.
   Full walkthrough: [`docs/postiz-instagram-setup.md`](docs/postiz-instagram-setup.md).
   To publish **YouTube Shorts**, connect each brand's YouTube channel in Postiz and set
   `YOUTUBE_LAYER8_CHANNEL_ID` / `YOUTUBE_LOFI_CHANNEL_ID` — the engine cross-posts reels
   as Shorts to both (uploads land **private** until the Google app is verified; flip them
   in YouTube Studio). Full walkthrough:
   [`docs/postiz-youtube-setup.md`](docs/postiz-youtube-setup.md). The engine still also
   promotes lofi YouTube *sessions* on Instagram via the "Now Live" posts.
5. **Customize the brand files** in `brand/` — this is what makes output sound like you.
6. **Enable the workflows** in the Actions tab.

## Weekly rhythm

| When | What you do | Time |
|---|---|---|
| After Tech Thursday | Drop transcript in `transcripts/`, update `calendar/topics.md` | 5 min |
| When a lofi session goes live | Nothing — the engine auto-pulls new YouTube uploads into "Now Live" promo posts. (Optional: hand-edit `calendar/topics-lofi.md` to steer.) | 0 min |
| Friday morning (automatic) | Weekly steering refresh scans the newest transcript, AI news, analytics coverage and virality notes, then updates `calendar/topics.md` + `analytics/weekly-steering.md` | 0 min |
| Nightly (automatic) | Engine opens a PR with tomorrow's layer8culture posts + visuals | 0 min |
| Daily (automatic) | Engine opens a separate PR with Layer8Culture Radio (lofi) posts | 0 min |
| Daily (automatic) | Engine opens a separate PR with The Real Estate Deal Lab client posts | 0 min |
| Each morning | Review PR(s) on GitHub mobile, edit, merge | 2-5 min |
| Each morning | Read the daily report | 1 min |

> **The approval PR shows a visual preview.** Instead of a plain text summary, the
> PR body renders each post Postiz-style — the image(s), the exact caption that will
> post, hashtags, format and schedule time — built from the queue by
> `scripts/build_pr_preview.py`. Images embed by the pushed commit SHA via

## Folder map

- `brand/` — canonical guidelines (brand-guidelines-v2.md for layer8culture;
  layer8culture_radio_brand_guidelines.md for the lofi brand) + operational digests
  (voice-layer8culture.md, voice-lofi.md, visual style, hashtags, **viral-formats.md** —
  the viral short-form video spec + STEPPS hook scoring). Read every run.
- `calendar/topics.md` — weekly steering for layer8culture ("lean into X this week").
  A Friday workflow refreshes this from the newest transcript, current AI news,
  and virality steering.
- `calendar/topics-lofi.md` — steering + "Now Live" video links for the lofi brand.
  The "Now Live" list is auto-refreshed from the Layer8CultureRadio YouTube channel
  by `scripts/fetch_youtube.py` at the start of each lofi run (no API key — public
  RSS feed; channel `UC0AQjSCaU9ByaU90XabBbHQ`).
- `clients/therealestatedeallab/` — isolated client brand lane for The Real Estate
  Deal Lab: brand, voice, visual style, hashtags, topics, and generation prompt.
- `transcripts/` — Tech Thursday transcripts (pillar content).
- `queue/` — generated posts awaiting approval (the PR contents). layer8culture uses
  `queue/<date>.json`; the lofi brand uses `queue/lofi-<date>.json`; Deal Lab
  uses `queue/deallab-<date>.json`.
- `posted/` — archive of published posts (feeds the report + dedupe).
- `analytics/` — Instagram Insights and coverage pulled back in (`insights.json`,
  `followers.json`, `coverage.json`, `insights-digest.md`,
  `social-assessment.md`, `weekly-steering.md`); the digest steers next-day
  generation and the assessment tracks cross-platform coverage gaps.
- `assets/library/` — your existing branded graphics + optional lofi audio bed
  (`lofi-bed.mp3`) and Tech Thursday recordings (for clip Reels).
- `assets/generated/` — OpenAI/Sora/ffmpeg outputs, named by post ID (images, carousel
  slides, reel mp4s + covers).
- `scripts/` — the machinery (`openai_gen.py` images, `reel_gen.py` video,
  `post_to_postiz.py` publishing, `list_postiz_channels.py` channel-ID lookup,
  `fetch_youtube.py` YouTube→"Now Live" refresh, `fetch_insights.py` analytics) +
  generation prompts (`generation-prompt.md` for layer8culture,
  `generation-prompt-lofi.md` for the lofi brand, and
  `clients/therealestatedeallab/generation-prompt.md` for the client lane).
  `.github/workflows/` — the schedule (generate, generate-lofi, publish, analytics,
  daily-report).
